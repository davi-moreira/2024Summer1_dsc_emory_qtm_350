While individual submission is mandatory, collaborative discussions are encouraged. Please note that no extensions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets aligned with some of covered topics will be assigned to solidify your learning. These sets are to be collaboratively developed in groups of up to three members, emphasizing the importance of code collaboration. Consequently, individual submissions will not be accepted. Assignments will be distributed via Canvas, and may be formatted as either a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), Quarto documents (.qmd), or HTML (.html). Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb, .qmd, or .html). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.",

You must refine your prompts to achieve desirable outcomes. Use the course knowledge for that!\nDo not blindly trust the information provided by the output. If the output contains a number, index, analysis, conclusion, or fact, assume it is incorrect and check its veracity. Any errors or omissions resulting from using the AI tool will be your responsibility.

The Honor Code of Emory College is based on the fundamental assumption that every loyal person of the University not only will conduct his or her own life according to the dictates of the highest honor, but will also refuse to tolerate in others action which would sully the good name of the institution. Academic misconduct is an offense generally defined as any action or inaction which is offensive to the integrity and honesty of the members of the academic community.

Note that each appointment will be 15-minutes long, and it may be done in a small group or individually. No appointments will be allowed nearing the exam dates.\nWhen attending virtual office hours, make sure you are in a private setting with a little to no background noise. The use of headphones is strongly encouraged. This is especially true when you are discussing private matters with the instructor.\nDo not use email for asking content-related questions, and do not use Canvas messages.\nDo not email me your private stories. Keep your email brief, and you will receive a response from me within 48 hours, except for the weekends. Similarly, if you receive an email from me, you are also expected to respond within 48 hours.

It can handle a number of different languages. We can use Python in RStudio using the reticulate package.\nCheck the intro to quarto notebook on how to use Python in Rstudio. Let’s cover some of the installation steps here:\nTo install RStudio, download from the following link. reticulate is a R package that allows one run a Python REPL in the R console. In addition, it allows one to read in and use Python code, and pass data between R and Python. The following provides instructions on installing reticulate.\nWith reticulate, you can use Rstudio as a IDE for Python. Another option is to use Quarto (the next-generation version of R Markdown) as an unified framework to generate notebooks with text + code. If you are an R Markdown user, you will see how Quarto is just an extension of the capabilities that were previously provided by R Markdown. Now, instead of .rmd files, we have .qmd files. Quarto is already installed with RStudio."

It also provides software resources.\nThe OS is divided into the kernel and user space.\nThe kernel is the core of the OS. It’s responsible for interfacing with hardware (drivers), managing resources etc. Running software in the kernel is extremely sensitive! That’s why users are kept away from it.\nThe user space provides an interface for users, who can run programs/applications on the machine. Hardware access of programs (e.g., memory usage) is managed by the kernel. Programs in user space are essentially in sandboxes, which sets a limit to how much damage they can do."

This option turns on -\b-a\ba.  It also negates\n             the effect of the -\b-r\br, -\b-S\bS and -\b-t\bt options.  As allowed by IEEE Std\n             1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”), this option has no effect on the -\b-d\bd, -\b-l\bl,\n             -\b-R\bR and -\b-s\bs options.\n\n     -\b-g\bg      This option has no effect.  It is only available for\n             compatibility with 4.3BSD, where it was used to display the group\n             name in the long (-\b-l\bl) format output.  This option is incompatible\n             with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-h\bh      When used with the -\b-l\bl option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n             Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n             number of digits to four or fewer using base 2 for sizes.  This\n             option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-i\bi      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode\n             number).\n\n     -\b-k\bk      This has the same effect as setting environment variable\n             BLOCKSIZE to 1024, except that it also nullifies any -\b-h\bh options\n             to its left.\n\n     -\b-l\bl      (The lowercase letter “ell”.)

Block sizes and directory totals are handled as described\n             in _\bT_\bh_\be _\bL_\bo_\bn_\bg _\bF_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt subsection below, except (if the long format\n             is not also requested) the directory totals are not output when\n             the output is in a single column, even if multi-column output is\n             requested.  (-\b-l\bl) format, display complete time information for\n             the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.\n             The -\b-D\bD option gives even more control over the output format.\n             This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-t\bt      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).\n             If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their\n             names in ascending lexicographical order.  The -\b-r\br option reverses\n             both of these sort orders.\n\n             Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence\n             is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending\n             order.  This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).\n             This feature can cause problems listing files stored with\n             sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital\n             cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image with\n             the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed\n             in the sequence in which they were taken.  To ensure the same\n             sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the\n             environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -\b-y\by option.  This\n             causes l\bls\bs to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting\n             files with the same modification timestamp.\n\n     -\b-u\bu      Use time of last access, instead of time of last modification of\n             the file for sorting (-\b-t\bt) or long printing (-\b-l\bl).\n\n     -\b-v\bv      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the\n             default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -\b-w\bw      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the\n             default when output is not to a terminal.  This option is not\n             defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-x\bx      The same as -\b-C\bC, except that the multi-column output is produced\n             with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.\n\n     -\b-y\by      When the -\b-t\bt option is set, sort the alphabetical output in the\n             same order as the time output.  This has the same effect as\n             setting LS_SAMESORT.  See the description of the -\b-t\bt option for\n             more details.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001\n             (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -\b-%\b%      Distinguish dataless files and directories with a '%' character\n             in long (-\b-l\bl) output, and don't materialize dataless directories\n             when listing them.\n\n     -\b-1\b1      (The numeric digit “one”.) Force output to be one entry per line.\n             This is the default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -\b-,      (Comma) When the -\b-l\bl option is set, print file sizes grouped and\n             separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned\n             by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period.  If no locale is\n             set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator, this\n             option has no effect.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std\n             1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     The -\b-1\b1, -\b-C\bC, -\b-x\bx, and -\b-l\bl options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used.\n\n     The -\b-c\bc, -\b-u\bu, and -\b-U\bU options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the file time used.\n\n     The -\b-S\bS and -\b-t\bt options override each other; the last one specified\n     determines the sort order used.\n\n     The -\b-B\bB, -\b-b\bb, -\b-w\bw, and -\b-q\bq options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.\n\n     The -\b-H\bH, -\b-L\bL and -\b-P\bP options all override each other (either partially or\n     fully); they are applied in the order specified.\n\n     By default, l\bls\bs lists one entry per line to standard output; the\n     exceptions are to terminals or when the -\b-C\bC or -\b-x\bx options are specified.\n\n     File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the\n     information associated with the -\b-i\bi, -\b-s\bs, and -\b-l\bl options.\n\n   T\bTh\bhe\be L\bLo\bon\bng\bg F\bFo\bor\brm\bma\bat\bt\n     If the -\b-l\bl option is given, the following information is displayed for\n     each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of\n     bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last\n     modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the\n     pathname.  If the file or directory has extended attributes, the\n     permissions field printed by the -\b-l\bl option is followed by a '@'\n     character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security\n     information (such as an access control list), the permissions field\n     printed by the -\b-l\bl option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -\b-%\b%\n     option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for\n     dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+'\n     character.\n\n     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or\n     future, and the -\b-D\bD or -\b-T\bT are not specified, then the year of the last\n     modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.\n\n     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -\b-n\bn\n     option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.\n\n     If the file is a character special or block special file, the device\n     number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a\n     symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “-&gt;”.\n\n     The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total\n     number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as\n     the directory's contents (which may or may not include _\b. and _\b._\b. and other\n     files which start with a dot, depending on other options).\n\n     The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with\n     option -\b-k\bk or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the\n     output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as\n     many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a\n     different size).\n\n     The file mode printed under the -\b-l\bl option consists of the entry type and\n     the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as\n     follows:\n\n           -\b-     Regular file.\n           b\bb     Block special file.\n           c\bc     Character special file.\n           d\bd     Directory.\n           l\bl     Symbolic link.\n           p\bp     FIFO.\n           s\bs     Socket.\n           w\bw     Whiteout.\n\n     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group\n     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character\n     positions:\n\n           1.   If r\br, the file is readable; if -\b-, it is not readable.\n\n           2.

(See below.)\n\n                These next two apply only to the third character in the last\n                group (other permissions).\n\n                      T\bT     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute\n                            or search permission.

The l\bls\bs utility does not show the actual\n     ACL unless the -\b-e\be option is used in conjunction with the -\b-l\bl option.\n\nE\bEN\bNV\bVI\bIR\bRO\bON\bNM\bME\bEN\bNT\bT\n     The following environment variables affect the execution of l\bls\bs:\n\n     BLOCKSIZE           If this is set, its value, rounded up to 512 or down\n                         to a multiple of 512, will be used as the block size\n                         in bytes by the -\b-l\bl and -\b-s\bs options.  See _\bT_\bh_\be _\bL_\bo_\bn_\bg\n                         _\bF_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt subsection for more information.\n\n     CLICOLOR            Use ANSI color sequences to distinguish file types.\n                         See LSCOLORS below.  In addition to the file types\n                         mentioned in the -\b-F\bF option some extra attributes\n                         (setuid bit set, etc.) are also displayed.  The\n                         colorization is dependent on a terminal type with the\n                         proper termcap(5) capabilities.  The default “cons25”\n                         console has the proper capabilities, but to display\n                         the colors in an xterm(1), for example, the TERM\n                         variable must be set to “xterm-color”.  Other\n                         terminal types may require similar adjustments.\n                         Colorization is silently disabled if the output is\n                         not directed to a terminal unless the CLICOLOR_FORCE\n                         variable is defined or -\b--\b-c\bco\bol\blo\bor\br is set to “always”.\n\n     CLICOLOR_FORCE      Color sequences are normally disabled if the output\n                         is not directed to a terminal.  This can be\n                         overridden by setting this variable.  The TERM\n                         variable still needs to reference a color capable\n                         terminal however otherwise it is not possible to\n                         determine which color sequences to use.\n\n     COLORTERM           See description for CLICOLOR above.\n\n     COLUMNS             If this variable contains a string representing a\n                         decimal integer, it is used as the column position\n                         width for displaying multiple-text-column output.\n                         The l\bls\bs utility calculates how many pathname text\n                         columns to display based on the width provided.  (See\n                         -\b-C\bC and -\b-x\bx.)\n\n     LANG                The locale to use when determining the order of day\n                         and month in the long -\b-l\bl format output.  See\n                         environ(7) for more information.\n\n     LSCOLORS            The value of this variable describes what color to\n                         use for which attribute when colors are enabled with\n                         CLICOLOR or COLORTERM.  This string is a\n                         concatenation of pairs of the format _\bf_\bb, where _\bf is\n                         the foreground color and _\bb is the background color.\n\n                         The color designators are as follows:\n\n                               a\ba     black\n                               b\bb     red\n                               c\bc     green\n                               d\bd     brown\n                               e\be     blue\n                               f\bf     magenta\n                               g\bg     cyan\n                               h\bh     light grey\n                               A\bA     bold black, usually shows up as dark grey\n                               B\bB     bold red\n                               C\bC     bold green\n                               D\bD     bold brown, usually shows up as yellow\n                               E\bE     bold blue\n                               F\bF     bold magenta\n                               G\bG     bold cyan\n                               H\bH     bold light grey; looks like bright white\n                               x\bx     default foreground or background\n\n                         Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.

The final product will be a cohesive document (README file) detailing their utopian data science project.\nFor example, my utopian data science project, Rhetoric, aims to daily collect and store all world politicians’ messages and speeches to forecast policy outcomes and regime transitions.\nProblem Set Instructions:\n\nSetting Up:\n\nForm groups of up to three members.\nEach group will create a new public repository on GitHub with the following name: 2024Summer1_qtm350_ps01.\nEach group will give a creative title to the utopian data science project.\nInitialize the repository with a README file describing the project’s goal.\n\nBranching Out:\n\nEach member will create their own branch from the main branch.\nAssign different sections of the README file to each member for parallel development.\n\nCollaborative Work:\n\nEach member should clone the repository to their local machine.\nMembers will checkout to their respective branches to start working on their assigned sections.\n\nCommitting and Pushing:\n\nAfter completing the work on their section, each member will commit the changes with a meaningful commit message.\nPush the commits to the corresponding remote branch on GitHub.\n\nPulling and Updating:\n\nBefore merging, each member should pull the latest changes from the main branch into their own to handle any new updates.\nResolve any merge conflicts that might arise and commit the resolution.\n\nCode Review and Merging:\n\nOnce all members have pushed their updates, perform a code/text review. You can use GitHub’s pull request feature.\nAfter reviewing, merge each feature branch into the main branch.\nEnsure that all members’ contributions are reflected in the main branch.\n\nFinalizing the README:\n\nCollaboratively edit the README file in the main branch to include:\n\nProject title, description, objectives, and members’s names.\nContributions by each member.\nChallenges faced and how they were overcome.\nAny references or resources used.\n\n\nSubmission:\n\nSubmit the link of the the GitHub repository thorough GradeScope. Do not forget to assign the group members!\nEnsure the main branch contains the final README file and any other project files.\nThe history should clearly show each member’s contributions and commits.\n\n\nAssessment Criteria:\n\nCollaboration: Participation from all members is evident from the commit history.\nDocumentation: The README file should be well-organized, informative, and reflective of the work done.\nCommit Quality: Commit messages are clear, concise, and descriptive of the changes made.\n\nHints!\n\nCommit frequently with clear messages that accurately describe each change.\nRegularly communicate with your team to avoid redundant work or conflicts.\nUse GitHub issues or project boards to manage and track tasks.\nReview each other’s code thoroughly before merging into the main branch.\nCheck the additional material in the topic webpage and slides.
