    "The `TreasureBox` class is a representation of a nested structure where each box can contain another box, akin to a set of Russian dolls. It is a custom implementation of a linked list data structure. Each instance of `TreasureBox` represents a node in the linked list, with two main attributes: `next`, which points to the next `TreasureBox` object, and `treasure`, which can hold a value of any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "When utilizing the `TreasureBox` class, one can imagine each instance as an individual container with the capability to encapsulate another container within it or to be wrapped by another container itself. This characteristic makes the `TreasureBox` an excellent model for understanding fundamental recursive concepts and for practical applications that require nesting or hierarchical structures, such as organizational charts, file systems, and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the class and its methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, treasure)`: This is the constructor for the `TreasureBox` class. It initializes a new instance with the provided `treasure` and sets `next` to `None`, indicating that there is no subsequent `TreasureBox` connected yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `append_outer(self, treasure)`: This method creates a new `TreasureBox` with the specified `treasure` and inserts it outside the current one. It does this by setting the `next` attribute of the new box to point to the current box (`self`). This effectively wraps the current box inside the new one. The method returns the new box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `append_inner(self, treasure)`: This method adds a new `TreasureBox` inside the innermost box of the current chain. It does this recursively by calling `append_inner` on the `next` box until it finds a box that does not have a `next` box (`self.next` is `None`). It then creates a new `TreasureBox` and assigns it to the `next` attribute of the innermost box. The method returns the original outermost box (`self`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get(self, depth)`: This method retrieves the treasure from a `TreasureBox` at a specified `depth`. If the depth is `0`, it returns the treasure of the current box. If the depth is greater than `0`, it recursively calls `get` on the `next` box, decrementing the depth each time, until it reaches the specified depth. If the depth is greater than the number of boxes, it returns `None`, indicating that the index is out of bounds (there's no box at that depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples on how to use these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To add a box outside the current box (wrapping the current one inside), `append_outer` is called, with the treasure of the new box as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To add a box inside the current chain (at the innermost position), `append_inner` is used with the desired treasure for the new inner box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To retrieve the treasure at a certain depth, `get` is called with the depth as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TreasureBox` class uses recursion to traverse and modify the linked list structure in both the `append_inner` and `get` methods. The `append_outer` method, on the other hand, is not recursive and simply reassigns the `next` attribute of a new `TreasureBox` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the `TreasureBox` recursive data structure demonstrates the elegance and power of recursion in both constructing and interacting with complex, nested data. The simplicity of its API—providing methods to add new elements and retrieve contents—makes it accessible for teaching recursion and for implementing real-world data structures that exhibit hierarchical characteristics."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordered Structure**: Each node contains a key (and optionally, an associated value) and has two distinguished sub-trees, typically referred to as the left subtree and the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Tree Property**: Each tree node has at most two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Property**: For any node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node’s key, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node’s key. This must be true for all nodes, meaning the tree is recursively ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Duplicates**: Each node's key must be unique within the tree, preventing multiple instances of the same key in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operations on Binary Search Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "BSTs support several operations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion**: Adding a new key to the tree while maintaining the BST property. This is done by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf, following the search property at each step to decide the turn direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deletion**: Removing a key from the tree. This can be complex because it must ensure that the BST property is preserved. There are three scenarios: deleting a leaf node (no children), a node with one child, and a node with two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search**: Locating a node with a given key. The tree is traversed starting from the root, moving left or right depending on whether the key is less than or greater than the current node’s key, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a systematic manner. Common traversal methods include in-order (left, root, right), pre-order (root, left, right), and post-order (left, right, root) traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding Min/Max**: The minimum key is found at the leftmost leaf node, and the maximum key is at the rightmost leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Successor/Predecessor**: The successor of a node is the next node in the in-order traversal, while the predecessor is the node that precedes the current node in the in-order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Operations like search, insertion, and deletion can be done in $O(log n)$ time complexity on average, which is efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorted Data**: In-order traversal of a BST yields the keys in sorted order, which can be useful for applications that require sorted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst-case scenarios**: In the worst case, such as when inserting sorted keys, a BST can become unbalanced and resemble a linked list with O(n) time complexity for operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: BSTs may require balancing to ensure that the tree remains efficient for all operations. Balancing a BST is a complex process and is handled by specialized trees like AVL trees or red-black trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "BSTs are widely used due to their dynamic nature and efficiency for operations that involve searchable data. They form the basis for more complex data structures like sets, maps, and associative arrays in many programming libraries."

    "Recursive data structures and nearest neighbor algorithms are concepts from different domains of computer science but can be connected in the context of data organization and search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Data Structures**: \n",
    "These are data structures that are defined in terms of smaller instances of the same type of data structure. For example, in a binary search tree (BST), each node has a value and pointers to two children, which are themselves binary search trees. Recursive data structures are often used to represent hierarchical data, and they naturally lend themselves to recursive algorithms for traversal and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nearest Neighbor Algorithms**:\n",
    "These algorithms are used to find the closest point(s) to a given point from a set of points. They are a key part of many applications, such as classification in machine learning, where an object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k-NN algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Connection**:\n",
    "Recursive data structures like BSTs can be used to efficiently implement nearest neighbor searches, especially in higher dimensions. For instance, the k-d tree (k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. K-d trees are a binary tree that recursively subdivides the space into halves, with each node representing an axis-aligned hyperrectangle. When searching for the nearest neighbors of a point, you would use the tree structure to quickly eliminate large portions of the search space, significantly speeding up the search as compared to a brute-force approach that compares the point against every other point in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how k-d trees connect recursive data structures with nearest neighbor searches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They use a recursive data structure (a binary tree variant) to recursively divide the space into smaller regions.\n",
    "- They enable efficient nearest neighbor searches by utilizing the tree's properties to prune the search space.\n",
    "- When searching for the nearest neighbor(s) of a point, the algorithm recursively traverses the tree, going deeper into the branches that may contain the nearest neighbor and skipping branches that don't, based on the minimum possible distance between the point and the regions represented by those branches.\n"

    "A k-d tree is a space-partitioning data structure that is particularly useful for organizing and searching for points in a k-dimensional space. Its applications are broad and include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nearest Neighbor Searches**: The primary use of k-d trees is to quickly find the nearest neighbor(s) of a given point. This is useful in many domains, such as pattern recognition, statistical machine learning for classification tasks, and data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Range Searches**: K-d trees enable efficient range searching, where you can query for all points within a given range. For instance, in a mapping application, a k-d tree can be used to find all locations within a certain distance from a user's current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geospatial Indexing**: In geographic information systems (GIS), k-d trees are employed to index spatial data like points on a map, allowing for fast querying of location data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: They can be used in dimensionality reduction problems, helping to organize points in high-dimensional spaces for algorithms like the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to work more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Collision Detection**: In computer graphics and gaming, k-d trees can help in collision detection by quickly identifying potential intersections between objects in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Robotic Motion Planning**: K-d trees are used in robotics for the rapid exploration of configuration spaces, which helps in planning the motions of robots avoiding obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Multidimensional Keys in Databases**: Database systems use k-d trees for indexing multidimensional keys, allowing for efficient processing of complex queries that involve multiple attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Approximate Matching**: In problems where an exact match is not required, or it's too expensive to find, k-d trees can be used to quickly find approximate matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Data Compression**: By structuring data points in space, k-d trees can support certain types of data compression schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-d trees offer average-case efficient performance, which is generally $O(log n)$ for many of its operations. However, their performance can degrade to O(n) in the worst case, particularly in high-dimensional spaces (the so-called \"curse of dimensionality\"). For high-dimensional spaces, other data structures such as ball trees or approximate methods might be more suitable."

    "Now, the 2-dimensional plot shows the first two levels of partitioning in a k-d tree.\n",

    "The lines divide the space into rectangles, each associated with a node in the k-d tree. The blue dots represent the data points, and their position relative to the lines indicates in which node of the k-d tree they would be located. The structure of these partitions reflects the hierarchical, recursive nature of the k-d tree, and the plot visualizes how a two-level k-d tree organizes the data in 2D space. Each subsequent depth would further subdivide the regions until each leaf node of the tree contains a small number of points, potentially down to a single point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clusters** in a k-d tree plot they simply represent how the k-d tree organizes the data points into different partitions for efficient nearest neighbor searches.\n",
    "- Each rectangular region formed by the intersecting lines can be thought of as a \"bucket\" that groups points together based on the splitting criteria of the tree at each depth. These regions become nodes in the k-d tree.\n",
    "- The points within each rectangle are not necessarily the closest to each other in the dataset; they just happen to fall within the same partition based on the dimension and the median value at that node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dots over the lines** represent data points that lie exactly on the splitting hyperplane at any given depth of the tree.\n",
    "- In 2D space, these \"lines\" are the splitting criteria — one line splits across the `x0` axis and the other across the `x1` axis. The dots on the lines are the points where the `x0` or `x1` value is equal to the median of the respective dimension used for the split at that level of the tree.\n",
    "- When building the k-d tree, these points could be assigned to either the left or right subtree arbitrarily, or some implementations may have a rule to decide on which side of the split such points should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The precise position of the dots, whether they're over the lines or not, is significant for how the tree will navigate during nearest neighbor searches, but it does not provide direct information about the density or the true \"closeness\" of the points unless we consider the actual distances between them.\n"

    "The code above is a method call to `approximateNearestNeighbour` on an instance of the `KDTree` class. It was used to find an approximate nearest neighbor to the query point defined by the numpy array `[1, 1]`. Let's check what it does step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Point**: The point we're interested in finding the nearest neighbor for is represented as a numpy array with coordinates `[1, 1]`. This point is in a 2-dimensional space, and in the context of the k-d tree, we're searching for the closest point in the dataset that the tree has been built with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Searching**: The method begins at the root of the k-d tree and compares the query point to the splitting value (`location`) of the node, which is determined during the building of the tree. The splitting value is the median of the dataset along the dimension that the node represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traversing the Tree**: Depending on whether the query point's coordinate in the current dimension is less than or greater than the node's splitting value, the search moves to the left or right subtree, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursive Descent**: This process is recursive — at each node, the algorithm decides which branch to follow (left or right) based on the comparison with the `location` and continues until it reaches a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Approximation**: Once a leaf node is reached, the method returns the data point associated with that leaf node as the approximate nearest neighbor. It's approximate because the algorithm does not backtrack to check other possible closer points that may be in different branches of the tree but happen to be closer to the query point due to the partitioning strategy.\n",
    "\n",

    "The code conduct a performance comparison between two methods of finding the nearest neighbor(s) in a dataset: using the k-d tree data structure and using a \"brute-force\" approach. The comparison is done for different sizes of datasets, and the time it takes to initialize the data structure and to query the nearest neighbor is measured and stored. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Sizes**: `n_sizes` is a list of integers that represent different sizes of datasets that the code will use for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Results Storage**: `results` is a `defaultdict` of lists, which is a convenient way to store the results of the timing experiments for each method and dataset size. The list `n_sizes` is also stored with the key `\"n\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dimension**: `d` represents the number of dimensions in the dataset. The code sets `d = 10`, indicating that each point in the dataset is a 10-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benchmarking Loop**: The code loops over each size `n` in `n_sizes`. For each `n`, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "   - Generate a random dataset `X` with `n` samples, each of `d` dimensions, using `np.random.rand(n, d)`.\n",
    "   - Generate a random query point with `d` dimensions using `np.random.rand(1, d)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **k-d Tree Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - Initialize a `KDTree` from `sklearn.neighbors` with the dataset `X`, and measure the time it takes to initialize the tree using `%timeit -q -o -r 3`. This is done quietly (`-q`), and the best result of 3 runs (`-r 3`) is taken. The average time is then appended to `results[\"KDTree init\"]`.\n",
    "   - Perform a nearest neighbor query on the `KDTree` with the generated query point and measure the query time, appending the average time to `results[\"KDTree query\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Brute Force Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - Execute a nearest neighbor search using a brute-force function `nearest_neighbour` with the dataset `X` and the query point, measuring the time it takes and appending the average to `results[\"Brute force\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the k-d tree method will be significantly faster, especially as the size of the dataset grows, due to its $log(n)$ average complexity, compared to the brute-force method's linear complexity $(O(n))$.\n",
